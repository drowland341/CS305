# CS305.

Client and Issue Summary:

Client: Artemis Financial is a consulting company providing individualized financial plans, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance.
Issue: The company wanted to enhance the security of its web application by adding a file verification step in the form of a checksum and ensuring secure communications using HTTPS.

Addressing Software Security Vulnerabilities:

I effectively identified and addressed the software security vulnerabilities by conducting a thorough analysis and implementing secure coding practices. This included integrating the AES-256 encryption algorithm, generating self-signed certificates, and configuring the application to use HTTPS.
Importance of Secure Coding: Coding securely is essential to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and cyber threats. Secure software adds immense value to a company's reputation, customer trust, and overall operational stability.

Challenges and Learnings:

The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was ensuring that all dependencies were up to date and free of known vulnerabilities. The process was also helpful as it provided insight into the importance of regular dependency checks. I gained a deeper understanding of how good security checks can improve a program throughout its continuous development. 

Increasing Layers of Security:

Layers of security were increased by implementing encryption, using secure certificates, and enforcing HTTPS. In the future, I would continue using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check to assess vulnerabilities and decide on appropriate mitigation techniques.

Ensuring Functionality and Security:

To ensure the code and application were functional and secure, I conducted extensive testing, including secondary and functional testing. After refactoring, I used the dependency-check tool to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

Helpful Resources and Tools:

Key resources and tools included the OWASP Dependency-Check tool, Maven for managing dependencies, and secure coding practices from the OWASP guidelines. These tools and practices will be valuable in future assignments and professional tasks. I referenced Stack Overflow frequently as well as other forums to find answers or alleviate some of my confusion. 

Showcasing Skills to Employers:

From this assignment, I would showcase my ability to conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment, implement secure coding practices, and use industry-standard tools to enhance software security. This demonstrates my knowledge and practical skills in developing secure software solutions.
